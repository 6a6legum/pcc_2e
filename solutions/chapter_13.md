# Solutions - Chapter 13
{: .no_toc }

The solutions for Chapters 12-14 are kept in a [separate repository](https://github.com/ehmatthes/pcc_2e_ai_solutions), because every exercise is a mini project. This page contains links to individual solutions in the repository.

If you haven't already seen the [cheat sheets](../../cheat_sheets/cheat_sheets/), there's a sheet that focuses on Pygame which you might find helpful when working on these exercises.

Also, it's helpful to have a look through some of the [Pygame documentation](https://www.pygame.org/docs/) as you work on these exercises. There are also direct links to specific pages in the documentation that are helpful for certain exercises.
